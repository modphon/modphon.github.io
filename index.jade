      Different is here.  Or more precisely, it is *almost*
      here. Meanwhile, please keep your eyes, ears and mind open.

      Coming April 2014 to an iPad near you...

      ## Community

      Our [community](http://community.modphon.com) is *the* place to
      discuss anything and everything about our apps and software.

      It uses [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org), the new forum software
      intended for the next decade instead of the last one.
