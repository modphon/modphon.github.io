<p>Mod Phon Ltd is a small company based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA.
   How small? Well, to be honest, it is currently one man with a few of
   his friends to help.
</p>
<p>Our mission is simple: we want you to have fun making noise. In
   particular, we want you to have fun making voice-like sounds with
   computers, tablets, mobile phones and whatever other digital devices
   the boffins out there eventually dream up.
</p>
<p>The founder of Mod Phon, Eric Carlson, has been playing with
   synthesizers for over thirty years, and for over twenty of those
   years he has been developing speech synthesizers. He holds an MA in
   Phonology from University College London.
</p>
<p>Shortly after Eric acquired his first iPad in mid-2012, he realised
   that something he had long envisioned might now truly be possible:
   to create a synthesizer of singing voices that can be played
   live. Not long thereafter, Mod Phon was born.
