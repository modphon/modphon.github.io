Voxen has been submitted to Apple for review. Barring problems, the
review usually takes one to two weeks, after which the app becomes
available on the App Store.

This is only version 1.0.0, however. Sir Winston Churchill, probably
not realising that what he was saying would apply to initial releases
of software, described the situation rather well in a speech at the
Lord Mayor's Day luncheon at the Mansion House, 9 November 1942:

> Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the
> end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

There remains a long road ahead for Voxen, and there are great things
yet to come. We already have many features in the pipeline that will
be added in the next few releases (e.g., MIDI support), and we even
have some far grander ideas for version 2.0. Stay tuned.

Meanwhile, we are looking forward to our humble version 1.0.0 being
available in the App Store soon. After then the true fun begins.
