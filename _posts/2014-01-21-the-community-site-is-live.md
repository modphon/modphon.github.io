The Community site is now live!

It uses [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org), the next generation of
forum software, and we are very excited about being amongst the first to
use this wonderful, new, open-source forum.

Please take a few minutes and see for yourself:
[community.modphon.com](http://community.modphon.com/). You can look
around all you want, but to participate you should
sign in via Google, Facebook, Twitter or Yahoo. Alternatively, you can
register the old fashioned way and then sign in. Your choice.
